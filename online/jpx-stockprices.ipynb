This type of analysis is better when comparing stocks to its peers.\n\nThe denominator is calculated by:\n\n1. Take the return variance(How far each number in a data set is from the average) from the average return in each of the incremental periods, square it, and sum the squares from all the incremental periods.\n\n2. Divide the sum by the number of incremental time periods.\n\n3. Take a square root of the quotient.\n\nThe Sharpe Ratio can tell us the risk-adjusted relative return. It can compare a stocks historical amount relating to its benchmark to the expected variablity of the return.\nIn other words the Sharpe Ratio compares reward to the risk. \n\nIf we wanted to find the Sharpe Ratio for Mcdonalds holdings we would first find the average annual return and then compare it to a low-risk investment like a government bond or ETF. We would subtract rate of the bond from Mcdonalds stock rate and then divide it by the Standard Deviation rate of Mcdonalds stock. Sharpe Ratios above 1 are considered \"good\" and offers excess returns compared to its volatility. However investors usually compare stocks in a portfolio with those in the market sector. So if Mcdonalds is in a ETF it would be compared with stocks in the Consumer Discretionary sector in USA, but this is not the same sector in Japan.","metadata":{"_uuid":"78da250d-92f0-44b6-86ee-098d85db459c","_cell_guid":"6d78e61b-3675-4d94-b3ae-323b2c9d7a56","trusted":true}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Lets use cardinality and correlation to eliminate unuseful columns","metadata":{"_uuid":"0e84998c-0c73-4551-8c6f-f2ea24053823","_cell_guid":"1ade6185-20f4-49ca-b905-99df40785fbd","trusted":true}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- column RowID is in string format is not useful as SecurityCode.

Less volitale means that the price is expected to stay around the average. There are several ways to measure volatility such as option pricing model and standard deviations of returns. \n\nWe also need to know the moving average which is the rolling mean or movin mean. It is the moving average that is used in time-series to capture the short-term swing while keeping up with the trends. The average can measure swings in seconds,minutes, hours and days or any selected time-frame. For our analysis we want to measure days and periods.\n\nTakeaways: A strategy to rank the stock you can use the Sharpe Ratio and set a buy vs sell alert. The alert will get triggered if the ratio is above 1.5 and also if the price is below the historical close price.\n\nIt will also be beneficial to keep track of trends and entry/exit timing. The trend can measure the current price relatice to the average high and low over the previous periods. The entry/exit measure the stock volume of buying and selling pressure. We can set a indicater to represent if the stock is oversold or overbought.","metadata":{"_uuid":"4a0e7c29-a9af-46a1-ae50-943e5581b1f8","_cell_guid":"9d19e0ed-77ff-4d31-bcd1-56f42579d693","trusted":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"_uuid":"10d42c8e-32e6-4aa4-9639-869d7a4afd47","_cell_guid":"b9ea73ed-0023-4985-a566-2db7889871b3","collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There was also some important things to consider such as the Equity Trading System failure on Oct 1, 2020 and other system failures for missing data","metadata":{"_uuid":"07c182f8-c40d-422a-99a8-9d727cc7267b","_cell_guid":"42ac81b0-112d-4b4a-ad18-caa6c1267b09","trusted":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"_uuid":"d703a7ef-255e-4939-a01a-765330d6ed75","_cell_guid":"36c77d49-473c-4004-b041-d6b547e608ac","collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{"_uuid":"71256207-b4ea-4184-b601-005143c4f30a","_cell_guid":"7a328266-1fb3-496f-9104-0610f260fe9c","trusted":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"_uuid":"43a9ff41-3f49-46d7-999b-dc502ad5dda6","_cell_guid":"a2631584-df51-4b1b-a09b-3554f257f374","collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Lets check and see how many stock appear in the set and compare to see if any have missing records","metadata":{"_uuid":"7084ccd5-8c43-441a-86bb-93db80878ce4","_cell_guid":"d081c2a6-fc36-468d-ae41-5061e7793032","trusted":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"stock_prices['SecuritiesCode'].value_counts()","metadata":{"_uuid":"88c6f6bd-6d91-4a8d-958e-45374b649b3f","_cell_guid":"cb36a371-fdea-4f57-984d-56a3ab3d037f","collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-12T19:34:41.069356Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-12T19:34:41.069667Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-12T19:34:41.108531Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-12T19:34:41.069640Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-12T19:34:41.107315Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We see that stock 1301 has a 1202 records and 4169 has 232 records.

In other words the Sharpe ratio creates a curve that the stock should follow and gives it a score or rank based off the closeness to that curve. Even if the price is above the curve then the rank can be skewed. Risk is assessed only off a deviation of the standard. It treats positive and negitive returns equally. Another fact about the Sharpe Ratio is uses a linear relationship meaning it expects the return to be equally impacted by the price. In reality investors consider the upside potential when buying stocks and other securites. Investors will buy volitile stocks with the potential of higher returns. An investor may ignore the ratio and sell, just so they can cut their loses. There are other variations of the Sharpe Ratio called Sortino Ratio that ignores the above-average returns and focus on the downside deviation to handle risk.\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jpx-tokyo-stock-exchange-prediction/overview\n\nhttps://medium.com/codex/algorithmic-trading-with-relative-strength-index-in-python-d969cf22dd85\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp\n\nhttps://www.educba.com/moving-average-formula/\n\nhttps://www.alphacodingskills.com/pandas/notes/pandas-function-dataframe-pct-change.php\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/code/onurkoc83/technical-features-trading-strategy\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/code/ikeppyo/examples-of-higher-scores-than-perfect-predictions","metadata":{"_uuid":"88cbbda2-efbc-4b6e-ba2b-54fa49494f81","_cell_guid":"779bb9e0-ff85-4a2f-a88e-790f98679d5e","trusted":true}}]}
